### Problem Statement
How can overseas Chinese citizens access the most updated travel information and quarantine policies so that they can plan their return trip easily, practically, and accordingly on an interactive platform?

### Problem Context
As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, many countries and territories have imposed travel restrictions for citizens and non-citizens. China is one of them. Numerous rules on flights, country of departure, reason of entry, etc. are imposed by the Chinese authority in order to slow the spread of the virus. In most cases, overseas Chinese citizens must follow all rules if they want to return their home country without hassle.  

Approximately 11 million people with Chinese citizenship residing abroad, according to World Migration Report 2020. Many overseas Chinese are eager to return to their home country due to a variety of reasons, including the rampant spread and inadequate control outside mainland China.  

Rules that Chinese government has imposed are rigid and comprehensive, considering the pandemic has been largely and effectively controlled within the Chinese border. Land borders are generally closed, and international flights are heavily restricted and overseen by Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC). The majority of inbound flights is cancelled under the “Five One” policy, which only allows mainland Chinese carriers to fly just one flight a week on one route to any country and foreign airlines to operate just one flight a week to mainland China. Ticket is extremely difficult to purchased in light of the shrinkage of flights, and the price reaches an extreme level.  

Booking the flight is the first step for the return trip; many other procedures have to be followed. Before boarding the flight, nucleic acid and antibody tests of COVID-19 are required at a specified testing institution based on the consular district. They must be conducted within 48 hours before boarding. A health code rendered by the Chinese embassy is also required for boarding. After landing, there is another compulsory quarantine in hotel, and the policy of the quarantine is varied by provinces and municipalities.  

The rules of return can be changed and adjusted at anytime by the Chinese authority without notice in advance. People are exasperated, since it is very frustrated to make an updated return plan that actually works.
